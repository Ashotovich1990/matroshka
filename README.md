#### I created this game in 3 days, inspired by an arcade game from my childhood. 

## RULES
 * if you drop three eggs you lose.
 * use "A", "Z", "K" and "M" on your keyboard to move the doll and the basket. 
 * as you play on the more and faster eggs will start coming on. 
 * and don't forget to turn the sound on ;)
